# You Only Look Once (YOLO): an object detection algorithm using Deep Neural
# Networks by Joseph Redmond, Santosh Divvala, Ross Girshick, and Ali Farhadi.
# Redmond (grad student) and Farhadi (advisor) continued to improve upon the
# work and has created several new versions of the algorithm. We are going to
# be using Redmond's latest YOLOv3 pre-trained with Microsoft's COCO database.
#
# Redmond quit the Computer Vision field in early 2020 due to concerns with the
# application of his research. He was opposed to Facebook and Google using his
# work to invade people's privacy and the military who might weaponize it. He
# famously tweeeted:
#    I stopped doing CV research because I saw the impact my work was having. 
#    I loved the work but the military applications and privacy concerns 
#    eventually became impossible to ignore.
#
# Redmon was challenged to consider the many potential benefits of his
# technology and if these benefits might outweight the potential abuses. In
# reponse, Redmond hinted that his work had already been used to create weapons
# and that his funding was coming from people who were trying to kill people
# more efficiently. This is perhaps as good a time as any to pause and consider
# the potential applications of our technology in light of our commitment to
# the Great Commission and pursuit of goodness, beauty, and truth.

#
# Since Redmond left the field, two new versions of his algorithm have been
# released, the most recent (v5) having some controversy of its own.
#   https://viso.ai/deep-learning/yolov5-controversy/
#
# Redmond is now a professional circus performer.
